The interpreter in python can be your best friend, both for experimentation and
documentation about Python objects. All of the datatype examples should be run
from a python interpreter.

How to get the python version without entering the interpreter:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python --version

How to enter the interpreter from a terminal/console window:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python

How to get help about an object or type (example, the int type). Hit 'q' to get
out of the help in most python interpreters.

::

   help(int)

Get a list of all module wide attributes, variables, methods, etc.

::

   dir()

Note that the output from the dir statement is in the python pretty printed
format. The pretty print format will always show a list (square brackets) and
all attribute names will be string elements in the list.

(example, the int type)
