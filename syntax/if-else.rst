*********
If / Else
*********

The form of an if...else block is slightly different in Python from other C
based languages.

NOTE: There is no switch statement in Python.

::

   >>> x = 42
   >>> if x < 0:
   ...     print "less"
   ... elif x == 0:
   ...     print "equal"
   ... else:
   ...     print "greater"
   ... 
   greater
